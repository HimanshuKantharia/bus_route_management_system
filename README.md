# bus_route_management_system

This is a very simplified bus route management system.
everything on this project requires the use of database & hence the mysql server on XAMPP should be active before execution.
you need to create a database schema called st1_project to get it working.
if this minor issue is resolve able please do it.
all the tables are automatically created upon the start of the code.

you start the web page strictly from the loginpage only, starting from any other page would cause errors.
need to add the use of sessions to remove this kind of error, to be completed.

the user page is very incomplete & the booking process is overly simplified, hence a more complicated UI & a slightly complex booking method would be useful.
